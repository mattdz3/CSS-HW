	<h1 class="title">THE WORLD OF CSS</h1>

	<p> Welcome to the world of CSS! This is where we are going to look some examples of how CSS can interact with your browser to create unique effects that will boggle your mind! Like check out that sweet gradient transition from grey to white, or this awesome font, neat right? All done with the power of CSS. </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<div class="para">Let's start off with an easy one. When you move your curser over a designated area, an action takes place. This is a feature in CSS called Hover!</div>



<div class="para2">WOW! Wasn't that awesome? Now lests try something a little different. Try clicking on our friend to the right. This is a property called active. It's similar to hover but the curser has to be pressed down to create the effect.</div>



<div class="para3">NICE! We can even combine the two features to make buttons to some cool things. Try the next one that has the hover and active states attached.</div>

<div class="para1">Sweet! Now check out the next button. we can also use CSS to change colors.</div>

<div class="para4">Sweet! Now lets move on to something a little more complicated! Check out this button. Notice how it has dimentions? Well you should, it makes it look all pretty and will make your website or app much more appealing. This is acheaved with a tool called box-shadow. Don't you just want to pust that thing?
I know you do.</div>

<div class="para5">WAIT JUST A SECOND! Why didn't it work? Well just using box-shadow won't do anything than make it look pretty. You need to combine it with the other properties we've learned about. Go ahead give it another shot.</div>

<div class="para6">How satisfying! you can almost feel that button go down. Now check this one out. What is that some kind of shadow?</div> 

<div class="para7">OH SNAP! Look how we used the modifier text-shadow to make the text seem to float right off the page. Now lets move on to something a little different.</div>

<div class="para8">WOOOH! DO A BARREL ROLL! Using keyframes you can set animations to repeat infinitly, keyframes are being used on this image to make it spin and on the title to change the font. </div>

<div class="para9">Barrell rolls are pretty cool but why don't we check out Megaman. Using the active state with your curser, you can trigger an image swap. Give it a shot!</div>

		<div class="line2"></div>
		<div class="line3"></div>
		<div class="line4"></div>
	</div>

<div class="para10">Let's take a look at the graph to the right. You can use hover to make interactive graphs.</div>

<div class="para11">So graphs are pretty cool. Let's try out something else. We've seen active and hover in action together, what if we add keyframes to the mix.</div>
