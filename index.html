	<h1 class="title">THE WORLD OF CSS</h1>

	<p> Welcome to the world of CSS! This is where we are going to look some examples of how CSS can interact with your browser to create unique effects that will boggle your mind! Like check out that sweet gradient transition from grey to white, or this awesome font, or even cooler that sweet scroll bar! Neat right? All done with the power of CSS. </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<div class="para">Let's start off with an easy one. When you move your curser over a designated area, an action takes place. This is a feature in CSS called Hover!</div>

<div class="para2">WOW! Wasn't that awesome? Now lests try something a little different. Try clicking on our friend to the right. This is a property called active. It's similar to hover but the curser has to be pressed down to create the effect.</div>

<div class="para3">NICE! We can even combine the two features to make buttons to some cool things. Try the next one that has the hover and active states attached.</div>

<div class="para1">Sweet! Now check out the next button. we can also use CSS to change colors.</div>

<div class="p1">Now Check this one out you can use active to change the font size!</div>

<div class="para4">Sweet! Now lets move on to something a little more complicated! Check out this button. Notice how it has dimentions? Well you should, it makes it look all pretty and will make your website or app much more appealing. This is acheaved with a tool called box-shadow. Don't you just want to pust that thing?
I know you do.</div>

<div class="para5">WAIT JUST A SECOND! Where did it go?
By using visibility: hidden; along with hover we can hide things. Neat! Now give it another go so you can get a feel for buttons.</div>

<div class="para6">How satisfying! you can almost feel that button go down. Now check this one out. What is that some kind of shadow? OH SNAP! Look how we used the modifier text-shadow to make the text seem to float right off the page. Now lets move on to something a little different.</div> 

<div class="para8">WOOOH! DO A BARREL ROLL! Using keyframes you can set animations to repeat infinitly, keyframes are being used on this image to make it spin and on the title to change the font. </div>

<div class="para9">Barrell rolls are pretty cool but why don't we check out Megaman. Using the active state with your curser, you can trigger an image swap. Give it a shot!</div>

<div class="transparent"></div>

	<div class="chart">
		<div class="line1"></div>
		<div class="line2"></div>
		<div class="line3"></div>
		<div class="line4"></div>
	</div>

<div class="para11"> We've seen active and hover in action together, what if we add keyframes to the mix.</div>

<div class="rectangle">WHEEEEE!</div>

<div class="para12">Awesome when you hover over the rectangle it starts to spin, but did you notice anything else? If you hover over the rectange again you might notice that the cursor changes to a finger instead of an arrow. NICE! What about some other keyframes. We can try active on one next.</div>

<div class="para13">So now lets mess with time. try to push the button on the right. Won't work? Wrong! Setting a transition-delay will stop an action from happening for a set amount of time. Try holding the button down for a few seconds.</div>

<div class="duration"></div>

<div class="monkey"> <img src="http://aceimgs.com/wp-content/uploads/funny-monkey-pictures-2.jpg"width="150" height="150"></div>

<div class="monkey2"> <img src="http://www.graphics99.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/i-saw-many-up-and-downs-of-life.jpg"width="150"height="150"> </div>

<div class="monkey3"> <img src="http://cl.jroo.me/z3/c/w/a/e/a.baa-Funny-monkey-with-glasses-pl.jpg"width="150"height="150"> </div>

<div class="monkey4"> <img src="http://janneblogt.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/funny-animals-monkey-in-glasses.jpg"width="150"height="150"> </div>

<div class="para14">Now lets examine these monkeys wearing glasses. Using the zoom feature in CSS we can get a better or sometimes a worse view of things using the hover or active states.</div>

<div class="move">OVER HERE!</div>

<div class="para15">This shape uses the active state with keyframes to change the direction the shape moves. And also set the time when you want it to change.</div>

<div class="para16">Let's try this one next. It says "BYE" what do you think it will do. It's set up with keyframes so if you hold down the button long enough it will reset because of the keyframe being set to infinite. Why don't we try one without infinite set. </div>

<div class="para17">This one has a keyframe that isn't set to infinite so when you click on it, it will only perform the action once.</div>

<div class="p18">We have seen a few keyframes such as rotate. Now let's look a a few different ones. This on is skewX.</div>

<div class="p19">Now lets check out one called scale.</div>

<div class="p20"> Now lets smash them togather! Check that out! it can deform both directions if you apply both keyframes to a single image.</div>

<div class="p21">Time for another! This is translate. It takes the entire shape and translates it a set number of pixels along the x and y axis. Now lets see what we can come up with using all of these.</div>

</div>

<div class="sidebar">

	<div class="ex1">OVER HERE!</div>

	<div class="ex2">CLICK ME!</div>

	<div class="ex3">PUSH!</div>
